This game is a 2D Puzzle Platformer with a focus on shifting between the foreground and background planes. The plane where Tony is located at a time, will have darker platforms, which indicate that they are able to be interacted with. Lighter platforms cannot be interacted with, as they are in the opposite plane. If you fall to the bottom of the screen, you will be reset at the beginning of the level.
